# chatterbox
This is a GPT-3 based chatbot abstraction that allows the user to easily configure an instance to behave in vraious ways.

For example, here is a ChatterBox instance configured to be a supporting frined (friend_example.py):

The conversation that this configuration yields is clearly very friendly and heartwarming:

And here is an example of a Chatterbox configured to be an annoying little brat (brat_example.py):

To use chatterbox you need an OpenAI API Key, as well as the openai package installed (pip install openai).

Once you have your OpenAI API Key, you can easily adapt the examples presented in *_example.py to use chatterbox however you like :)
